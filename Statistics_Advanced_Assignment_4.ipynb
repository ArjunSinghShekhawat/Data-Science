    "Q1: A t-test is used when the population standard deviation is unknown, and a z-test is used when the population standard deviation is known. For example, a t-test can be used to compare the means of two groups when testing a new drug's effectiveness, while a z-test can be used to analyze a large sample's mean test scores when the population standard deviation is known.\n",

    "Q2: A one-tailed test examines the relationship in one direction (e.g., greater than or less than), while a two-tailed test looks for a relationship in both directions (e.g., not equal to). For instance, in a one-tailed test, you might check if a new product's sales are significantly higher than a certain level, while a two-tailed test could assess if a coin is fair (not biased in either direction).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: Type 1 error occurs when a true null hypothesis is rejected, while Type 2 error happens when a false null hypothesis is not rejected. For example, in medical testing, a Type 1 error could lead to unnecessary treatment, and a Type 2 error might result in a missed diagnosis.\n",

    "Q5: A confidence interval is a range of values that likely contains a population parameter with a specified level of confidence. To calculate it, you use the sample data, margin of error, and a confidence level. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the average height of students in a class.\n",

    "Q7: The 95% confidence interval for a sample with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 5 would range from 47.5 to 52.5. It means that there's a 95% probability that the true population mean falls within this interval.\n",

    "Q8: The margin of error quantifies the uncertainty in a sample estimate. A larger sample size decreases the margin of error, improving the estimate's precision. For example, a poll with 1,000 participants will have a smaller margin of error compared to one with 100 participants.\n",
