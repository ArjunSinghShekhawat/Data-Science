    "Q1: Assumptions for ANOVA include the normality of residuals, homogeneity of variances, and independence of observations. Violations could be skewed data, unequal variances, or correlated observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: The three types of ANOVA are one-way (single factor), two-way (two factors), and repeated measures (within-subjects). One-way ANOVA is used when comparing multiple groups. Two-way ANOVA assesses the influence of two factors on a response variable. Repeated measures ANOVA analyzes data from repeated measurements on the same subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: The partitioning of variance in ANOVA separates the total variability into components due to different sources. Understanding this concept helps identify the sources of variation and assess their significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: To calculate SST, you sum the squared differences between each data point and the overall mean. To find SSE, sum the squared differences between data points and their group means. SSR is the difference between SST and SSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: In a two-way ANOVA, you calculate main effects for each factor separately and an interaction effect by considering the joint influence of the two factors. Python libraries like SciPy or statsmodels can help with these calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: An F-statistic of 5.23 with a p-value of 0.02 suggests there are significant differences between groups. The low p-value indicates that the observed differences are unlikely due to random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: Handling missing data in repeated measures ANOVA depends on the nature and extent of the missingness. Common methods include listwise deletion, imputation, or modeling. The choice can affect results and bias the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8: Common post-hoc tests include Tukey's HSD, Bonferroni, and Scheff√© tests. Use these tests when ANOVA reveals significant group differences. For example, Tukey's HSD is used when you have three or more groups and need to compare all possible pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9: To conduct a one-way ANOVA in Python, use libraries like SciPy or statsmodels. After running the analysis, report the F-statistic and p-value. If the p-value is less than the chosen significance level, there are significant differences between the diets.\n",
