    "Q2. Grid search CV explores all specified hyperparameter combinations, while randomized search CV randomly samples them. Use grid search when computational resources allow comprehensive exploration, and randomized search for efficiency.\n",

    "Q3. Data leakage occurs when information from the test set inadvertently influences model training, leading to overestimation. Example: Using future data for predictions.\n",

    "Q4. To prevent data leakage, strictly separate training and test data, preprocess data consistently, and be cautious with feature engineering.\n",

    "Q5. A confusion matrix summarizes the model's classification performance, displaying true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.\n",

    "Q6. Precision is the ratio of true positives to all predicted positives, focusing on the accuracy of positive predictions. Recall is the ratio of true positives to all actual positives, emphasizing the model's ability to capture true positives.\n",

    "Q7. Analyzing a confusion matrix reveals if the model has a bias toward false positives, false negatives, or balanced errors. It helps identify areas for model improvement.\n",
